# CS 330 – Computational Graphics and Visualization

# Designing Software
I approached the scene by breaking the image into simple primitives like boxes, cylinders, and spheres. This project helped me improve at translating 2D reference images into 3D layouts, applying both textures and lighting to make them feel realistic. The design process was iterative: add one object, texture it, light it, then adjust. These tactics can be reused in future projects where modular and incremental design is critical.

# Developing Programs
I learned new strategies such as shader management, texture mapping, and integrating Phong lighting. Iteration played a big role—early milestones gave me a base scene, and each step layered in new functionality like camera movement, textures, and lighting. My coding evolved from rough prototypes to structured, reusable functions for transforms and draw calls.

# Future Goals
Computational graphics has given me strong experience blending math with programming, which supports my path toward software engineering. These skills carry into both education and professional areas—whether for visualization, simulations, or interactive applications. The ability to design and render environments expands how I can approach complex technical problems.
